# sysdumpanalyzer-python
sysdumpanalyzer for AR11

What the script does?

The script extracts the sysdump file and reads all the logs and config files to gather system information and
also errors and warnings in the log files present in the sysdump.

The script when completed succesfully will generate 2 files

Text Files - xxxxx_errorsandwarns.txt and xxxxx_systemdetails.txt

What do the output files contain?

xxxxx_errorsandwarns.txt - Contains ERRORS, WARNINGS in all the logs files inside the sysdump
xxxxx_systemdetails.txt  - Contains system level details from the AR11 appliance

How do we run the script?

You can either use Python 2.x(x >=7) or Python 3.x to run the script. Please downloand the appropriate file as we have
separate files for Python 2.x and Python 3.x.

-- Run the script using python command
-- Enter the fullpath along with sysdump file name
